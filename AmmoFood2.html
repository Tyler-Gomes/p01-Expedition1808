  The next morning you arrive to the meeting and Lewis begins distributing small
   slips of paper to each man. He explains that this is to elect a second in command.
   Lewis reminds the men that this person will likely be in charge of their daily
   activities, so choose wisely.  You are a highly regarded person in the Corps
   so you view the vote as more of a formality. After 10 or so minutes of deliberation
   the votes are tallied. In a close race you barely edge out a man named Hugh
   Glass. In the back of your mind you sort of wish Glass won, but Captain Clark
   has already given you an assignment. There is debate whether then men should
   carry more Ammunition or more Food? The men carry a large load already, but
   many want to bring additional ammo in the event of a Native attack. Lewis is
   concerned about men starving without the additional food. As the bridge between
   the men and him he asks you to make the decision.

    CHOICES

 <ul>
   <li><a href="Ambush.html"> Carrying less food and more ammunition makes the
     most sense to you. Ammunition is non-perishable and can be utilized for
     much more, plus it gives the men more peace of mind. You reason that because
     the Frontier Corps is filled with former trappers foraging for food would
     not be too difficult for the Corps to handle. You inform Captain Lewis of
     your choice and he announces to the men that they can requisition double
     the ammo. The expedition begins tomorrow. </a></li>
   <li><a href="Fort.html">The expedition will go no further than its
     provisions allow it. The saying goes that an army marches on its stomach
     and this Corps is no different. The Natives will not have the chance to
     ambush the men if the Corps starves first. You reason that during the winter
     it will be extremely difficult to forage for food, and using ammunition to
     hunt for food is just going to burn through ammo while constantly alerting
     Natives to the Corps position. You tell Lewis of your opinion and he passes
     word to the men. With extra food in pack the men ready themselves for
     departure the next morning.   </a></li>

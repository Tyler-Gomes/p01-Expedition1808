  You have been riding north for about a month without a trace of the western
  passage. One morning you notice that there is campfire smoke on the horizon.
  You and your men move cautiously towards it. Upon approach you are confronted
  by a Native lookout. You quickly realize that he is a member of the same Oar
  tribe that offered you assistance in the spring. The lookout brings you into
  camp and you begin asking about the western passage. The elders of the Oar
  tribe agree to lead you and your men to the western passage. After a short
  ride you come upon a river of epic scale. You estimate that it is two miles
  wide. The Natives assist you in constructing boats for the voyage home. As
  you depart eastward down the passage you think back to all the men that you
  have lost upon the way. After a few weeks of sailing the passage you begin
  seeing more and more recognizable terrain. Pretty soon you enter the Grand
  Lakes of the Northern Republics. You realize that you are home. As news
  spreads about the western passage thousands of American settlers scramble
  westward hoping to stake out a new life. The surviving men of the Frontier
  Corps and you are hailed as national heroes.

  With the Corps now completely mounted on horseback you are now covering vast
  amounts of ground everyday. You still have not sighted anything that resembles
  a western passage; in fact the Corps is more concerned with moving westward
  than anything else at this moment. After many weeks of hard riding and very
  little incidents of note, you begin noticing sea birds. The coast is only
  moments away. Soon you can smell the ocean, and after a momentary climb to the
  top of a nearby hill you catch first sight of the Pacific Ocean. You have done
  it. The Frontier Corps of the U.A.R has traversed the entire continent. This
  disappointment of not finding the western passage wears of with the realization
  that you are the first group of men to cross the country. The task you are now
  confronted with is establishing a permanent U.A.R presence on the west coast. As
  the men construct the fort, you think about the western passage. Part of you wants
  to lead a separate expedition to find it on the way back east, while part of
  you wishes to stay on the west coast and help establish relations with local tribes.

 <ul>
   <li><a href="End2.html"> You ask for volunteers for the return trip home
     including a search for the western passage to your surprise a sizeable
     number of men volunteer for the expedition. You take whatever provisions
     you can and begin riding North. Because you are only packing a small amount
     of supplies you will not be able to construct forts. If you do not find
     the western passage within two months you will have to begin the ride to
     the winter fort in order to make it through the winter.  </a></li>
   <li><a href="End3.html">You decide to stay on the west coast and help establish
     diplomatic relations with the Natives living on the Pacific seaboard. You
     feel like you would better serve your country helping establish positive
     ties with the local populace. These Natives were technically citizens of the
     U.A.R now so you begin work on a census for the new territories. You also
     believe that if there is a western passage. The Natives are likely to know
     about it and it would be far easier to find with local Native help.  </a></li>

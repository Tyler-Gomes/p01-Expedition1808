  The expedition departed on May 14, 1808 and by late November your party has
  traversed hundreds of miles worth of river and plains. You have met and
  traded with many Native people, relations with the Natives thus far has been
  peaceful. As the Corps moves off of the plains you see mountains ahead. The
  mountains are already snowcapped preventing any passage until spring so Captain
  Lewis suggests the company set up camp for the winter. Since the Corps packed
  the extra provisions most of the energy is spent making the fort as livable as
  possible and sending out scouts to potentially contact any nearby tribes. The
  men go out in parties of 3. The men use the remaining horses to cover large
  amounts of ground in a day. One of the scouting parties returns with 3 horses
  and only 2 riders. When asked about what happened the men explain that the missing
  man, Hugh Glass, was riding in front when he was struck with a barrage of arrows.
  The horse he was riding was spooked, knocking glass to the ground and began
  running in the opposite direction of the Natives. The horse followed the other
  men back to the fort. More scouts return telling of a large Native war party
  moving towards the fort. The Frontier Corps is far outnumbered, but they hold
  the fort and a complete provision for the winter. The war party appears from
  the woods, Captain Lewis panics and put you in charge of the Corps. The men
  begin manning defensive posts.

 <ul>
   <li><a href="NoAmmo.html"> You sense that the Natives are stalling their
     first wave against the fort. You sense an opportunity to seize the initiative,
     you order the men to open fire and defend the fort to the last. This
     virtually guarantees a winter of fighting and raids, however the Corps is
     well supplied with food.  Your only concern is that this siege will likely
     consume the a large amount of ammunition and men will undoubtedly be killed
     in the fighting. Also, fighting is not what these men are used to. Morale
     will surely be damaged from a winter of fighting. </a></li>
   <li><a href="NoFood.html">As the Natives surround the fort they appear
     apprehensive to attack. You recognize that there might be a peaceful way
     out. You order your men to stand down and send your Native guides out as
     envoys. The guides return saying that the tribe demands a portion of the
     Corps winter provision. You are outnumbered at least 5 to 1, and you have
     the excess supplies anyways. You agree to hand over the provisions in
     exchange for safe hunting grounds. You hope the trapping parties have good
     luck, or else it will be a hungry winter. </a></li>

  <p>
  The next day the men of the Frontier Corps are gathering their final supplies
  for the voyage. Each man is to pack 60 pounds of gear and food over the entire
  duration of the trip. This weight does not include 10-pound rifle each man
  must carry. Some men shorten the barrel in order to save some weight and to
  carry a few more rounds of ammunition. The territory the Corps is trekking
  through is considered dangerous for many reasons but the threat of Native
  ambushes weighs the heaviest on everyoneâ€™s mind. The men want to carry
  as much ammunition as possible, however Captain Lewis fears the men will
  carry less food if they bring more ammo. Starving men could be a far
  worse situation than any Native ambush. He tasks you with making the
  decision on how much of which provision to bring more of: ammunition
  or food?

    CHOICES

 <ul>
   <li><a href="Ambush.html"> Carrying less food and more ammunition makes the
     most sense to you. Ammunition is non-perishable and can be utilized for
     much more, plus it gives the men more peace of mind. You reason that because
     the Frontier Corps is filled with former trappers foraging for food would
     not be too difficult for the Corps to handle. You inform Captain Lewis of
     your choice and he announces to the men that they can requisition double
     the ammo. The expedition begins tomorrow. </a></li>
   <li><a href="Fort.html">The expedition will go no further than its
     provisions allow it. The saying goes that an army marches on its stomach
     and this Corps is no different. The Natives will not have the chance to
     ambush the men if the Corps starves first. You reason that during the winter
     it will be extremely difficult to forage for food, and using ammunition to
     hunt for food is just going to burn through ammo while constantly alerting
     Natives to the Corps position. You tell Lewis of your opinion and he passes
     word to the men. With extra food in pack the men ready themselves for
     departure the next morning.   </a></li>

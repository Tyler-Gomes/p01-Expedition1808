  After deciding to leave the hostile Natives alone, they ceased to bother the
  men of the Frontier Corps. Of course the men were still afraid to enter the
  woods to trap for food, so the result was a long hungry winter. So hungry in
  fact that Captain Lewis thought of abandoning the expedition. In addition to
  the issues already faced by the lack of food, a small outbreak of a deadly
  fever occurred. In all about 30 men of the Frontier Corps perish during the
  winter. It was at this point that we learned of the fate of the hostile Native
  tribe. They were eventually wiped out during the winter by another local tribe
  called the Oar people. When spring began the Oar began sending envoys to the
  Corps fort, the Oar made it clear that they were friendly and willing to trade.
  The Oar had captured large quantities of rifles from the vanquished tribe.
  They offer to contribute men for the expedition in exchange for your remaining
  ammunition. Accepting the men will spread supplies thin, but the advantage of
  Native guides may be beneficial to the Corps. The morning of the decision
  Captain Lewis and a few others desert the expedition. The Oar people offers
  30 men for your use, as the Frontier Corps commander the decision is yours.

 <ul>
   <li><a href="End1.html"> 	You decide to welcome the 30 Natives into
     the Frontier Corps. You figure the extra men will be able to provide for
     themselves, as they are Natives. Also the Oar claim to know the western
     passage, which is what the Corps is searching for. The extra men depart the
     fort with your remaining men.  This integration of Natives and U.A.R citizens
     is unprecedented, you hope this will eventually lead to less future conflicts
     with tribes that lie ahead. </a></li>
   <li><a href="ContinueSolo.html">You decide that even though the Natives have
     extensive knowledge of the upcoming terrain, the burden of an additional
     30 men will ultimately slow the expedition to the point that they may have
     to spend another winter forted up before they reach the Pacific Ocean.
     Also weighing on your mind is the thought that these Natives could simply
     abandon the Corps if the going gets too tough. To have 30 men abandon during
     the middle of a trek would be disastrous. Plus with the reduced number of men,
     every member of the Corps will now be on horseback.  </a></li>

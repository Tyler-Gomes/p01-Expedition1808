  <p>
  After a long and arduous winter, the Frontier Corps begins to pack out of the
  fort they have many battles for. The decision to engage the Natives led to a
  violent winter that took a large number of lives. Over 30 men of the Corps
  including Captain Lewis have been killed in battle and numerous others
  have been wounded. In an event of incredible coincidence you learned that
  another local tribe of Natives, the Oar people, was fighting the same hostile
  band of natives. The Oar people have been struggling against the French-supplied
  Rio people for months. A alliance was formed between the Corps and the Oar
  tribe and together you crushed the Rio tribe. You pillage the French weapons
  and ammunition to resupply your used stock. Now that you are moving westward
  again the Oar people offer 30 men to continue the expedition with the Corps as
  repayment for assisting in defeating the Rio tribe. It is the understanding
  that the men will guide the Corps to the western passage, however the additional
  men will no doubt cause strain on the already depleted amount of provisions.
  As the new commander of the Frontier Corps the decision is yours to make.

 <ul>
   <li><a href="End1.html"> 	You decide to welcome the 30 Natives into
     the Frontier Corps. You figure the extra men will be able to provide for
     themselves, as they are Natives. Also the Oar claim to know the western
     passage, which is what the Corps is searching for. The extra men depart the
     fort with your remaining men.  This integration of Natives and U.A.R citizens
     is unprecedented, you hope this will eventually lead to less future conflicts
     with tribes that lie ahead. </a></li>
   <li><a href="ContinueSolo.html">You decide that even though the Natives have
     extensive knowledge of the upcoming terrain, the burden of an additional
     30 men will ultimately slow the expedition to the point that they may have
     to spend another winter forted up before they reach the Pacific Ocean.
     Also weighing on your mind is the thought that these Natives could simply
     abandon the Corps if the going gets too tough. To have 30 men abandon during
     the middle of a trek would be disastrous. Plus with the reduced number of men,
     every member of the Corps will now be on horseback.  </a></li>

  A year has passed since you made the decision to stay on the west coast.
  The settlement you founded here, Lewisville, has become a embassy to the
  local Native tribes. You have worked hard at establishing relations with all
  of the tribes, and have been attempting to gather population information.
  In addition to the Natives, there is a growing American population too. This
  is due to the discovery of the western passage. After holding meetings with
  local chiefs the Natives began leading men of the Corps to the western passage.
  You ordered these men to return east with the news immediately. The news was
  huge on the east coast and soon settlers were flowing westward uninhibited.
  The rapid development of the territory under your watch has led the President
  of the U.A.R to admit the Western Republic to the United American Republics.
  Its capital will be Lewisville, and until a proper election can be held you
  are appointed governor.

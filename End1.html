  The Natives lead you and the remaining Corps north for a couple days. You
  begin to doubt if the natives know where they are headed at all, you wish
  Captain Lewis were still around so he could make a decision. After a week of
  seemingly aimless wandering, you and the men come upon a great river of unimaginable
  proportions. The Natives inform you that this is the great western passage. After
  a few short days of ship building you set sail down the passage. You cannot
  believe your luck, all of these years the western passage has just been a
  myth, but now here you are. Cooperating with the Natives was the best decision
  you could have made. Within a few short weeks the Frontier Corps gets its
  first view of the Pacific Ocean. You feel immense pride knowing that you not
  only made it to the Pacific, but you successfully navigated the western passage.
  You think back to the winter fort and all those who did not make it, including
  Captain Lewis. The men of the Corps begin building a permanent fort. Some men
  will stay behind to start forming diplomatic ties with the local tribes. You
  decide to make the trip back east with the Oar&#39;s. You are hailed as a
  national hero, and within months American settlers are making their way down
  the western passage to begin settling the Pacific coast.

  <p>
  The expedition departed on May 14, 1808 and by late November your party has
  traversed hundreds of miles worth of river and plains. You have met and traded
  with many Native people, relations with the Natives thus far has been peaceful.
  As the Corps moves off of the plains you see mountains ahead. The mountains
  are already snowcapped preventing any passage until spring so Captain Lewis
  suggests the company set up camp for the winter. The majority of the men are
  assisting Lewis in building the winter fort; you are assigned a group of men
  to lead on a hunting party. Due to the amount of ammunition packed hunting for
  food daily is the norm. In preparation for the winter you are attempting to
  take as much game as possible. On your second day of hunting, your hunting
  party is shocked to find that one member of the crew is missing. You order
  the remaining men to spread out and begin searching. At that moment you hear
  a single shot, followed by a volley of gunfire fired in return. It becomes
  obvious that there is a large group of hostile Natives nearby; the men look to
  you for a command.

 <ul>
   <li><a href="NoAmmo.html"> You decide to go after the Natives in hope of
     recovering your missing member. The amount of gunfire that has occurred
     no doubt alerted the back at the fort that there is trouble. You send a
     runner back to the fort to tell the rest of the Corp will organize into
     small militia to assist you in fighting the Natives. This battle will
     likely expend the additional ammunition and you will undoubtedly lose men
     but it will prevent turning the area into hostile woods too dangerous for
     hunting. Even though a few men will become casualties this will allow you
     to properly prepare for the winter. </a></li>
   <li><a href="NoFood.html">You tell the men to split up and move silently back
     to the fort. You will tell Captain Lewis of the Native force and to prepare
     for a siege. By choosing not to engage the Indians you cede the woods to
     the Natives as Lewis will no longer allow hunting parties into the woods
     to avoid further loses. The food for the winter will have to be caught in
     the nearby river, however the catch is unlikely to be enough. By not fighting
     the Natives now you preserve hope for peaceful relations in the spring.  </a></li>
